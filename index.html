            <span class ="card-title">Wireframe</span>
            <p>Always create a wireframe before you start work! Putting things down on paper makes it easier to visualize what you will be working on! Having a sketch of what your design will look like makes it easier to code it out!</p>

            <p>Always think of the user. You aren't making things just for yourself! A website is meant to be used, so make it easy for the user! Make sure  to test your design out on people and ask for feedback. Don't get too attached to anything in your design. It's important to think about the useability and the experience of the user.</p>

            <span class="card-title">Fonts</span>
            <p>While it's important to give your site life, don't over do it with your font options! Choose a font for titles or logos that is unique but legible. You want people to remember what they're looking at! Avoid using that for your copy [all of the other text that will live on your webpage]. You don't want your user doing mental gymnastics while they are trying to read whatever you're writing about!</p>

            <span class="card-title">White Space</span>
            <p>White space or negative space is your friend. Use it to bring focus to the most important aspects of your work. A cluttered website does not lead to a happy user experience. That said, too much white space will have the same effect. Learn the balance!</p>
